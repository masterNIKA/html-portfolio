<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>my name is nika, i am 19 years old and i study information technologies at business and technology university.
  i just started web development and i find it quite interesting to be honest.
</p>

<p>i have been studying for over two weeks and i have only made small progress but still its really impressing.
  i am really excited about styling my own websites and can't wait to do so.
</p>

<p>i am not 100% sure that i will become web developer in the future, i am still in between fields that i am interested in.
  although web development is really fun and easy to start with so will see about that.
